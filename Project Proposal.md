Project Proposal

FocusTrack: AI-Powered Browsing Analytics and Productivity Enhancement

1. Team Members and Roles:
- Su Young (Mel) Kwon: Product Design/Data Analysis/Product Development
- Woo Jeong (Michelle) Sohn: Data Collection/Data Analysis/Product Development

2. Objectives: FocusTrack is a browser extension designed to enhance productivity by providing real-time browsing analytics, structured research summaries, and strategic nudges to maintain focus. It helps users understand digital habits, optimize time management, and stay on task.
a. Target Users
- Students with multiple priorities and information sources.
- Individuals struggling with attention span and memory retention.
- Users seeking productivity improvements and better self-management.
b. Key Challenges
1) Information Overload: Difficulty in organizing and recalling previously viewed content.
2) Time Mismanagement: Lack of awareness regarding time distribution across content types.
3) Frequent Distractions: Unintentional browsing interruptions reduce productivity.
c. Goals
1) Enhance Thought Organization: Provide tools to structure research and revisit study paths.
2) Improve Time Management: Offer insights into time allocation and efficient multitasking.
3) Maintain Focus: Reduce distractions and support goal-oriented browsing.

3. Approach and Implementation: FocusTrack integrates AI-powered analytics and behavioral science to optimize browsing habits.
a. Core Technology
- Browser History Analysis: Tracks browsing patterns and time allocation.
- Machine Learning Classification: Identifies focused vs. distracted states.
- Visual Analytics Dashboard: Displays time usage and productivity metrics.
- Behavioral Nudge System: Provides data-driven interventions to maintain focus.
b. Key Features
1) Research & Thought Organization
- Topic Summarization: Daily summaries of primary research topics and search patterns
- Automatic History Classification: AI-powered categorization of browsing history
- Thought Chain Mapping: Visual representation of how ideas and research evolved throughout sessions
2) Multitasking & Time Management
- Category Analysis: Breakdowns of time spent across predefined categories 
- Digital Routine Summary: Daily and weekly visualizations of digital habits and time allocation
- Productivity Patterns: Identification of optimal focus times and potential scheduling improvements
3) Focus Enhancement & Nudging
- Real-time Detection: Identification of inefficient browsing patterns as they occur
- Strategic Alerts: Context-aware notifications when attention appears to be drifting
- Social Comparison: Anonymized benchmarking against peers or high-performers
- Focus Metrics: Tracking of average and maximum focus duration with improvement goals

4. Evaluation Metrics:
- Improved Research Efficiency: Faster retrieval of previous research.
- Reduction in Unintentional Browsing: Measured decrease in distractions.
- Increased Focus Duration: Longer sustained attention periods.

5. What is already in place?: We tested FocusTrack at 2025 TartanHacks, extracting browsing history and using LLM models to summarize search topics. A Chrome extension was developed for data visualization.

6. Risks and Challenges:
We expect some data limitations since we can only use data available through browsing history extraction Chrome extension and limited diversity of media type (only text and images). There may be computation constraints since both members lack previous coding experience.

7. Timeline & Milestones:
a. Spring Semester
- March 3-16: Proposal, environment setup, literature review, initial data processing.
- March 17-30: AI model development, frontend architecture setup.
- March 31-April 14: Report drafting, frontend refinement, final presentation prep.
b. Summer Semester
- April: Data logging, AI model optimization, Chrome extension development.
- May: Beta product release, user testing, data analysis.
- June: Final report compilation, academic paper writing.

8. Implementation Phases:
- Phase 1: Chrome extension for browsing data collection and basic classification.
- Phase 2: Enhanced analytics, visualization, and user customization.
- Phase 3: Personalized nudges, social comparison, and advanced research tracking.
